/**
 * Called when a player joins the TabList system.
 *
 * <p>This event is fired when a player connects to the server and is
 * registered with the DreaminTabList system. It provides an opportunity
 * to customize the player's initial TabList configuration.
 *
 * <p>This event is cancellable. If cancelled, the player will not be
 * registered with the TabList system and will see the default Minecraft
 * tab list behavior.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @EventHandler
 * public void onPlayerTabJoin(PlayerTabJoinEvent event) {
 *     Player player = event.getPlayer();
 *     PlayerTabManager manager = event.getPlayerManager();
 *
 *     // Customize tab for VIP players
 *     if (player.hasPermission("vip")) {
 *         manager.setHeaderAndFooter(
 *             Component.text("ยง6VIP Server"),
 *             Component.text("ยง7Welcome, " + player.getName())
 *         );
 *     }
 *
 *     // Cancel for certain players
 *     if (player.getName().equals("TestPlayer")) {
 *         event.setCancelled(true);
 *     }
